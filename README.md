## About the Portfolio

This portfolio is a Flask-based application featuring:

- Backend: Written in Flask with SQLite database and SQLAlchemy.
- Templating: Utilizes Jinja for dynamic content rendering.
- Frontend: Developed using vanilla JavaScript, SASS/SCSS, and Bulma for a responsive UI.
- Data Handling: Employs JSON file handling for certain data structures.
- Form Processing: Uses WTForms with server-side and client-side validation.
- Additional Features: Custom error pages, pagination, and secrets stored in environment variables.

## My Career Goals

I am actively seeking job opportunities in the realms of Backend Development, Frontend Development and Development Operations (DevOps). My focus is on roles that allow me to leverage my strong Python background and expand my JavaScript skills with React. 

## Technical Skills

- **Python**: I have 3 years of experience and I have invested time in understanding the language deeply before jumping into frameworks.
- **JavaScript**: Focusing on learning the core language before diving into frameworks like React.
- **Web Development**: Strong with HTML, CSS, and have a good understanding of web architecture.

## Future Plans

I plan to expand Flask skills to Django, and my JavaScript skills and delve into React and React Native for more complex frontend projects. Additionally, I'm currently working through AWS skill build, so I can make use of AWS for all my development needs.
