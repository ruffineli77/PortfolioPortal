  <h1 class="title is-1">About Me</h1>
  <div class="experience-section section-container">
    <p class="large-article"> I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with a passion for problem-solving and creating efficient solutions. I am currently working on completing my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/" target="_blank">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a> certification. I am also exploring <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/" target="_blank">Werkzeug</a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a>, where I aim to make meaningful open-source contributions, starting with bug fixing and eventually the documentation itself once I've become familiar. I employ <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile" target="_blank">Agile</a> methodologies in my projects and utilize <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software" target="_blank">Jira</a> for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. Flask has given me the opportunity to make my own decisions for which library or design pattern to use for my projects. As I begin to learn stricter languages, my experience with Flask, which allowed me to choose packages and design patterns freely, will give me insight into why one method or decision is better than another. I prefer to work on a Unix/Linux system and <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/" target="_blank">Debian</a> is my distribution of choice. Although my specialization lies in backend development, my versatile skill set enables me to effectively contribute to server-side, client-side, and DevOps tasks, whether working independently or in a team setting. </p>

      <p class="title is-4">What I Do</p>
      <p class="subtitle is-5">Backend & Frontend Development</p>
      <p class="large-article"> With a strong leaning towards backend development, I excel in building scalable and robust server-side logic using Python and Flask. However, I don't shy away from frontend work and can craft interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. My skill set is rounded out by personal projects and open-source contributions, enabling me to adapt to the unique needs of any development team. </p>

      <p class="title is-4">My Focus</p>
      <p class="subtitle is-5">Data and Server-Side Functionality</p>
      <p class="large-article"> My main focus lies in learning how to construct data-centric backend solutions that are scalable and efficient. I'm particularly interested in the data architecture for natural language processing or <a href="https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-natural-language-processing/" target="_blank">NLP</a> focused AI models. I'm currently transitioning my projects from SQLite databases to a PostgresSQL database. This way I can have one system to secure, test and backup for all of my applications to use. Docker and GitHub actions have kept my projects streamlined and easily deployable. I excel in developing APIs, managing databases, and implementing server-side logic that can accommodate a project's unique requirements. I believe that a strong backend is the backbone of any successful application, and I strive to contribute this expertise to any team I join. Following these principles I will learn C, Java, and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/" target="_blank">Django</a> as my next web application framework.</p>

      <p class="title is-4">Balanced Programming Skills</p>
      <p class="subtitle is-5">Mastering Both Low-Level and High-Level Programming</p>
      <p class="large-article"> My approach to programming is holistic, aiming to strike a balance between high-level abstractions and low-level intricacies. While I appreciate the rapid development and ease that high-level frameworks offer, I make a concerted effort to understand the underlying mechanisms they abstract away. This deep understanding empowers me to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, and adapt to unique project requirements more effectively. For instance, when it comes to automated testing, I opt for writing my own tests and fixtures, or at least thoroughly dissecting pre-written ones to understand their inner workings. This ensures not just the ability to run tests, but also the capacity to understand, modify, and improve them as needed. My two-pronged approach allows me to respect the efficiency of abstraction without becoming over-reliant on it, positioning me as a developer who can both 'build quickly' and 'build well.' </p>
